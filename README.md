# ArunaWeb 5.0

This is another total revised web version for the Aruna Object Storage website. Powered by [tabler.io](https://tabler.io/), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). For now only an experimental rudimentary version is available, this will be expanded further.

The web version is a fully integrated website + webserver version including SSR + hydration.

This version is intended to be used with version 2.x.x of the Aruna Object Storage server.
Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) and 
[Vue 3 documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) to learn more.
